  <summary><h1>üíª Latest Projects</h1></summary>
  <h2>Final Projects</h2>

  <h3>Full-Stack Backgammon AI/RL agents <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/class/775" target="_blank">(Deep Reinforcement Learning class)</a></h3>
<p align="left">
  Implementation of Expected Minimax with Œ±‚ÄìŒ≤ Pruning, variations of Temporal Differences including TD(0), TD(Œª), and Monte Carlo Simulation.

  Please see my <a href="https://github.com/markshperkin/BackgammonAI-backend/blob//master/report/final%20report.pdf" target="_blank">Final Report</a> for more information.
  
  This project used the <a href="https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~xling/cs346a/extra/tdgammon.pdf" target="_blank">(Temporal Difference Learning and TD-Gammon)</a> research paper to assist in the algorithm design.
  
  This project highlights the effectiveness of Reinforcement learning and simulation-based algorithms in tackling complex games, such as Backgammon, with an enormous state space of 10^20 possible configurations, where simple brute-force approaches struggle to capture the nuanced tactics employed by expert players.

  <h3>Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network for Human Activity Recognition <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/class/714" target="_blank">(Edge and Neuromorphic Computing class)</a></h3>
<p align="left">
  Implementation of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8438" target="_blank">A Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network Model for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)</a> architecture for classifying human activity recognition 3D skeletal dataset into 49 different categories from the <a href="https://rose1.ntu.edu.sg/dataset/actionRecognition/" target="_blank">NTU RGB+D</a> dataset, achieving 87.6
% classification accuracy. 
  
Please see my <a href="https://github.com/markshperkin/HAR-STGCN/blob/master/report/final%20report.pdf" target="_blank">Final Report</a> for more information.
  
   This result underscores the promise of ST-GCNs for real-time human action recognition, with potential applications in medical monitoring (e.g., distress-gesture detection in clinical and assisted-living environments), security surveillance in high-risk facilities, and objective sports performance analysis.

   The ultimate goal was to provide an affordable and effective solution for biomechanical analysis, enabling athletes and coaches to optimize performance and minimize injury risk through precise, data-driven insights.

<h3>AI Underwater Swimmer Pose Estimation <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/class/584" target="_blank">(Neural Networks and Their Applications</a> and <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/class/585" target="_blank">Machine Learning Systems classes)</a></h3>
<p align="left">
  Developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://gamecocksonline.com/sports/swimming/" target="_blank">University of South Carolina's Division I SEC swim team</a>, this project focuses on underwater swimmer pose estimation to analyze and improve athlete performance. Using a custom pose estimation architecture, the model captures the anatomical pose of swimmers by detecting keypoints during their strokes.
  
  The project involved collecting and labeling underwater swimming data and training a pose estimation model using the HRNet architecture. I updated the data pipeline to work with up-to-date libraries, as the <a href="https://github.com/leoxiaobin/deep-high-resolution-net.pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">publicly available code</a> was outdated and incompatible, ensuring smooth data processing and model training.

  The collected poses are intended to help analyze swimming techniques and identify areas for improvement. As the next step, I plan to use these keypoints to train a model capable of providing tailored recommendations to enhance the athlete's efficiency, technique, and speed, ultimately leading to faster and more efficient swimming.

  This project bridges the gap between sports performance analysis and cutting-edge technology to help athletes reach their full potential.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Mark's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
<h2>Blossoming Passion and the Thrill of the Challenge:</h2>

<p>My passion for coding blossomed at the University of South Carolina, where I was constantly challenged and inspired by a supportive community. One of the most rewarding aspects of my coding journey has been the immense satisfaction that comes from solving coding problems. It is about cracking a complex puzzle or finally reaching the summit after a challenging climb. The initial frustration of grappling with a problem, followed by the "aha!" moment when the solution clicks into place, is a uniquely exhilarating experience.</p>

<h2>Fueled by Accomplishment:</h2>

<p>This sense of accomplishment fuels my motivation to tackle even more intricate challenges. It's a continuous learning process, where every solved problem opens the door to new possibilities and ignites a desire to explore further. The joy of problem-solving is what truly fuels my passion for coding and propels me forward on this exciting journey.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Real World:</h2>

<p>Graduation marks a transition from the structured learning environment to the dynamic world of professional development. While the curriculum and specific problem sets may change, the thrill of problem-solving and the satisfaction it brings remain constant. I'm eager to test my skills in real-world scenarios, tackling complex problems that impact businesses and communities. The prospect of collaborating with experienced developers and contributing solutions that address tangible challenges is incredibly exciting. I'm confident that the foundation I built at USC, coupled with the continuous learning spirit fostered by the coding community, will equip me to navigate these new challenges and experience the profound satisfaction that comes with making a real-world impact through code.</p>
